					<p>This multiple-choice quiz takes you through the Recruitment section starting on p299 of Mouse Guard 2nd Edition. It will build a list of stats at the bottom of the page as you complete it. You can then copy that to your character sheet and fill out the remaining wordy bits.</p>

					<h3>What is your Guard Rank?</h3>
					<h4>Restrictions:</h4>
					No more than one Guard Captain per group - this rank can only be played by consent of the group because you would be a major character in Mouse Guard.<br /><br />
					No more than one Patrol Leader per group - the group doesn't need one to play a game, but it is nice to have one. Consult the group if you want to be a Patrol Leader.<br /><br />
					You should only play Tenderpaw if you have played Mouse Guard before. You'll need a good grasp of the rules to make the most of it.
