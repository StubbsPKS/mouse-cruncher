#Mouse Cruncher

An app for quickly generating Mouse Guard characters at the table.

This multiple-choice quiz takes you through the Recruitment section starting on p299 of Mouse Guard 2nd Edition. It will build a list of stats at the bottom of the page as you complete it. You can then copy that to your character sheet and fill out the remaining wordy bits.
